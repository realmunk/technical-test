# Unfold Technical Tests

This repository contains three different technical test implementations.

## Overview

- `test-1`: Vanilla JavaScript implementation using Parcel bundler
- `test-2`: React implementation with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- `test-3`: Next.js implementation with TypeScript and TailwindCSS

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Test 1: Vanilla JavaScript

A vanilla JavaScript implementation using Parcel bundler.

### Setup and Running

```bash
cd test-1
npm install
npm start    # Starts development server with hot reload
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:1234` by default.

## Test 2: React Implementation

A React implementation with TypeScript and TailwindCSS support.

### Setup and Running

```bash
cd test-2
npm install
npm start    # Starts development server
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Test 3: Next.js Implementation

A modern Next.js implementation with TypeScript and TailwindCSS, using Turbopack for faster development experience.

### Setup and Running

```bash
cd test-3
npm install
npm run dev   # Starts development server with Turbopack
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Development Notes

- Each test implementation uses different technology stacks to showcase various approaches
- All implementations include TypeScript for better type safety
- Test-2 and Test-3 use TailwindCSS for styling
- The Next.js implementation (Test-3) uses Turbopack for enhanced development experience
